# medical-magicmirrore
Opengl, OpenCV and Mediapipe basic Augemented Reality application for visualizing CT scans 3D renders.

# Project Description
Augmented Reality (AR) is a constantly developing field in computer science. Research efforts have
been continually intensified thus creating solutions for various domains. Especially in the medical field by
superimposing the real world on top of the virtual, computer generated information, the perception of natural
environments can be enriched. In fact, AR has the potential to help enhance medicine. in different ways such
as AR education systems that are used to train the student surgeons to acquire the critical skills in error saved
virtual environments.

This project aim to realize Magic Mirror augmented reality application where users can see themselves
with augmented graphics on a large display. This application is aimed toward medical school students and
teachers. Virtual organs are augmented individually onto the body of the participants. Hence, eliminating the
need of mannequins.
